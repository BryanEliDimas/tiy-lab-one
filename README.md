**Good news Rubyists!**  
We have a week of records tracking what we shipped at Planet Express.  I need you to answer a few questions for Hermes.

1. How much money did we make this week?
2. How much of a bonus did each employee get? (bonuses are paid to employees who pilot the Planet Express)
3. How many trips did each employee pilot?
4. Define and use a class for each shipment

Different employees have favorite destinations they always pilot to

* Fry - pilots to Earth (because he isn't allowed into space)
* Amy - pilots to Mars (so she can visit her family)
* Bender - pilots to Uranus (teeheee...)
* Leela - pilots everywhere else because she is the only responsible one

They get a bonus of 10% of the money for the shipment as the bonus
